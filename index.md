I'm currently a software engineer at [Sidewalk Labs](https://sidewalklabs.com) where I lead a small
team thinking about privacy-preserving digital identity for cities.

I was previously at [AppNexus](https://appnexus.com), where I worked on distributed systems for ad
tech. We did some cool stuff in the ad mines, including a custom [epoch-based memory
allocator](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/common/an_malloc.c), [the world's fastest
`itoa`](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/src/an_itoa.c), and several [interesting
indexing data
structures](https://github.com/appnexus/acf/blob/master/common/an_interpolation_table.c).
